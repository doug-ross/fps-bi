FPS BI - First Person Shooter Business Intelligence

FPS BI is a term I coined to describe placing data in an immersive visualization environment. Imagine being able to move through three-dimensional data like you are in a "first person shooter" game such as Duke Nukem or Doom.

I put a demo up here: http://fpsbi.com to illustrate the concept using d3.js and babylon.js.
